INFO:Security:54 - 'xc3s500e' is a WebPack part.
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.

Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal RS232_RxD connected to top level port RS232_RxD has
   been removed.
Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:1186 - One or more I/O components have conflicting property values.
    For each occurrence, the system will use the property value attached to the
   pad.  Otherwise, the system will use the first property value read.  To view
   each occurrence, create a detailed map report (run map using the -detail
   option).
Running delay-based LUT packing...
Running related packing...
Updating timing models...
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_3/secondNumber_or0000
   is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the
   CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_3/current_s_cmp_eq0014
   is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the
   CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_3/current_s_cmp_eq0017
   is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.24

Peak Memory Usage:  213 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  2 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Mapping completed.
